    "This chapter will teach you how to read images from file or create them from arrays. You will learn the basics about how medical images are typically structured. What may surprise you is that medical images are not just dumb arrays. They have important metadata associated with them -- for example, orientation, spacing, and direction -- that helps you know more about the images.\n",
