    "In the previous sections, you learned how to handle both individual images and entire collections of images and related meta-data via datasets. To train medical imaging AI models, however, it is necessary to combine your data records into a single array / tensor called a \"batch\". The `nitrain.Loader` class is the way to accomplish this task in a flexible and powerful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will go through the basic ways to generate trainable batches of data from your dataset. In future chapters in this section, we will expand on these basic examples by adding samplers and random augmentation transforms.\n"
