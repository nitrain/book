    "This section until this point has been focused on mapping collections of images and meta-data in whatever format is needed and wherever they may be. However, we have always assumed until now that the images returned from the dataset are in perfect condition and harmonized with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, that is rarely the case. We often work with images that are a variety of imperfections that we must correct before reading them in from their raw form. This can include images have different shapes or orientations from one other, having unnormalized intensity values with outliers, or simply not being in the format needed for our AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call these types of preprocessing steps as \"fixed transforms\". They are fixed because they are deterministic and will give the same result regardless of how many times they're applied to the image. "
