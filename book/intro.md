# Introduction

Welcome to the book that takes you through the entire workflow of building medical imaging AI models. This book will teach you how to accomplish any medical imaging AI task using the nitrain framework. Nitrain builds on top of any of your favorite frameworks such as pytorch or keras by giving you high-level tools specifically aimed at training models on medical imaging datasets.

Each chapter of this book can be read independently, so if you are looking to enhance your skills in one specific area then feel free to skip around.

The book is generally organized according to the various steps of a medical imaging AI workflow:

- reading medical images
- creating medical imaging datasets
- loading batches of augmented medical images
- training models
- explaining model results
- sharing and hosting models

## Why use nitrain?

You may be wondering why we use nitrain to teach you about medical imaging AI workflows. The simple answer is that nitrain is the easiest way to train medical imaging AI models using pytorch or keras. It provides a very clear set of classes that help users easily conceptualize the entire medical imaging AI workflow.

### Similar frameworks

Nitrain is not the only framework that makes it easier to train AI models on medical imaging datasets. Others include ANTsPyNet, Nobrainer, MONAI, Huggingface, and Pytorch Lightning - all fantastic frameworks. However, nitrain provides some features that others dont:

- ability to train and manage models in the cloud directly from the console
- sharing of models with the commmunity and easy fine-tuning of pre-trained models
- algorithms to help you explain model weights in the context of your medical images

While most of the frameworks above provide at least one of these features, none of them provide all like nitrain does.
