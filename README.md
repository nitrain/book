# Becoming a medical imaging AI expert with Python

This book will take you through the entire medical imaging AI workflow from data to deployment using the nitrain framework and pytorch.

A final published draft is expected in early 2025.

## About the book

By going through this book, you will learn how to tackle any medical imaging AI problem in Python. That includes building regression, classification, or image-to-image models for any type of medical imaging processing task. It is split up into the following sections that operate more-or-less independently in case you want to sharpen your skills in one particular area:

- Handling medical images
  - Installing libraries
  - Reading and writing
  - Visualization
  - Applying operations
  - Basic processing
- Loading imaging datasets
  - Using datasets
  - Loading from file
  - Loading from the cloud
  - Processing transforms
- Generating image batches
  - Using dataloaders
  - Types of inputs
  - Augmentation transforms
  - Using samplers
- Creating models
  - Using architectures
  - Pre-trained models
  - Custom models
- Training models
  - Local GPU training
  - Cloud-based training
  - Training on nitrain.dev
- Explaining model results
  - About explainers
  - Occlusion algorithms
  - Visualizing results
- Sharing models
  - Registering models
  - Writing model cards
  - Advice for publications
- Appendix
  - References
