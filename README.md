# Becoming a medical imaging AI expert with Python

This book will take you through the entire medical imaging AI workflow from data to deployment using the nitrain framework and pytorch.

## About the book

By going through this book, you will learn how to tackle any medical imaging AI problem in Python. That includes building regression, classification, or image-to-image models for any type of medical imaging processing task. It is split up into the following sections that operate more-or-less independently in case you want to sharpen your skills in one particular area:

- Handling medical images
- Loading imaging datasets
- Creating batches of images
- Training models
- Fine-tuning models
- Explaining model results
- Sharing and deploying models
