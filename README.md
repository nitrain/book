# Becoming a medical imaging AI expert with Python

This book will take you through the entire medical imaging AI workflow from data to deployment using the nitrain framework and pytorch.

## About the book

By going through this book, you will learn how to tackle any medical imaging AI problem in Python. That includes building regression, classification, or image-to-image models for any type of medical imaging processing task. It is split up into the following sections that operate more-or-less independently in case you want to sharpen your skills in one particular area:

- Handling medical images
- Loading imaging datasets
- Creating batches of images
- Training models
- Explaining model results
- Sharing and deploying models

## About the author

Nicholas Cullen has a BS in Systems Engineering from University of Florida and a PhD in Neuroscience from Lund University in Sweden. He has 10+ years of experience developing tools for medical imaging in Python, R, and C++. He has published 40+ high-impact journal articles on biomarkers, clinical trials, and neurodegenerative diseases.

He started nitrain to make medical imaging AI more accessible to clinical researchers. If you have any questions, he can be reached at nickcullen31@gmail.com.
